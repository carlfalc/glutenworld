## Hidden Gluten in Medications & Supplements

### The Shocking Truth About Pills

Most people with celiac disease know to check food labels, but **medications are often overlooked**. The FDA doesn't require gluten labeling on medications, making them a dangerous blind spot.

**Common Medications with Gluten:**

1. **Generic Ibuprofen** - Many store brands use wheat starch as a binder
2. **Birth Control Pills** - Particularly generic versions
3. **Antacids** - Wheat-based fillers for tablet formation
4. **Vitamins** - Especially chewable and gummy varieties
5. **Probiotics** - Often grown on wheat-based mediums

### Real User Story
> *"I was taking a daily vitamin for three months and couldn't figure out why I felt sick constantly. Our scanner app detected gluten in the 'natural coating' – it was wheat-derived. I had been poisoning myself daily."* - Sarah M., app user
