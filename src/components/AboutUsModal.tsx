              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Gluten World is a worldwide network of passionate developers and health advocates who have personally 
                experienced the challenges of navigating life with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, and other food 
                allergies. Our journey began from frustration with unclear food labeling, hidden gluten derivatives, 
                and the lack of comprehensive tools to help those with dietary restrictions live confidently.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-primary">Our Story</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                As developers who struggled with understanding the implications of confusing food labels, we experienced 
                firsthand how products often don't clearly display what's actually in them. Even worse, many contain 
                derivatives or traces of gluten that aren't immediately obvious to consumers. This personal struggle 
                drove us to create a comprehensive solution that goes beyond basic ingredient lists.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                We realized that the challenge wasn't just about identifying gluten-free products, but about building 
                a supportive community where people could share their experiences, discover safe recipes, and access 
                tools that truly understand the complexity of living with dietary restrictions.
